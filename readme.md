# Finder
## _A simple powerful tool for finding things_

Finder is a tiny Go tool with a ReactJS frontend.

This is an idea I've had for a long time and decided to throw together a small POC.

Right now the tool is limited to mp3 files and it works surprisingly well. I have plans to continue development and include many more features. 

## POST Request

The frontend is not fully hooked up yet. If you want to experiment with finder, please run the go code and make POST requests at the service using Postman or similar.
