# Finder
## _A simple powerful tool for finding things_

Finder is an mp3 search engine, built on Go with a ReactJS frontend.

This is an idea I've had for a long time and decided to throw together a small POC.

Right now the tool is limited to mp3 files and it works surprisingly well. I have plans to continue development and include many more features, this might eventually include other file formats but for now mp3 will do.

~~## It's ugly but it works

~~The front and backend are now conected and everything is working as a rough prototype.

Next up is to tidy how the results are displayed. Then I will finish the scraper tool to return more exact results.

Front end is currently broken (post request data not being ingested correctly), requests can still be made directly to the go service using postman or similar.
