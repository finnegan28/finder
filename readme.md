# Finder
## _A simple powerful tool for finding things_

Finder is a tiny Go tool with a ReactJS frontend.

This is an idea I've had for a long time and decided to throw together a small POC.

Right now the tool is limited to mp3 files and it works surprisingly well. I have plans to continue development and include many more features.
